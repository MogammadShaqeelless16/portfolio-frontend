I've had the privilege of contributing to esteemed institutions such as the University of Cape Town, where I served as a Web Migrator QA Tester, ensuring the seamless transition of websites and supporting quality assurance processes. Prior to this, I honed my skills as a Software Developer at Red-i, where I was immersed in web development, technical support, and documentation tasks. Additionally, my tenure as an Assistant Developer at the University of Cape Town and IT Support role at FTA Enterprise equipped me with invaluable experience in content management, technical assistance, and staff training.
